# Calculator Project - Final project (JS Fundamentals on The Odin Project)

I would assume it would be obvious, I will be creating a calculator using all the information learnt the Javascript Fundamentals on The Odin Project. There will be more that I will require to search for sure but thats where all the learning happens.

## Initial Commit

Just some boilderplate details and the basic files.

## Add some basic JS

Very basic JS functions added for a calculator and also an operator function that accepts an operator and two numbers.

## Add some basic HTML/CSS

Buttons were added to resemble a calculator and also CSS to design it very scarsely. I used a grid for the number and the operator buttons, it felt it was a btter fit than flex.
